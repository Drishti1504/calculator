# Web Calculator â€“ Practice Project

This calculator was created while following a YouTube tutorial by **Prashant Sir**.

After learning the core logic, I customized it by adding:
- A custom background image
- Font styling
- Hover effects on the buttons

This practice helped reinforce my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Practiced
- JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling
- HTML structure and form elements
- Styling UI with CSS
